# Physics custom cwl file for Sublime Text
# If you created some user commands which are difficult to remember, you can create a custom cwl file like this one here, which is useful to write LaTeXing documentations. Just save the created cwl file in the Sublime Text package directory under: Packages/User/cwl and include the file in the LaTeXing static_cwl sublime-settings.
